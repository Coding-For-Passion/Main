# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help out this project.

Please note that we are currently not accepting anymore full contributors but pull requests are always welcome


## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Coding-Passion-Project](https://github.com/Rywee/Coding-Passion-Project/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, please make sure to be VERY CLEAR

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * More coming soon... come back later
Thanks,
