<h2> Mercy </h2>
<p>Mercy is the most healing oriented of the Supports, capable of rapidly bringing her team back up to full Health and even using her Ultimate to bring them back from the dead. When not healing, she is able to boost a single ally's damage, allowing them to blast apart foes and tear through barriers. She is easily the most team dependent of the Supports: her personal damage is weak, and the powerful effect of her Ultimate makes her a prime target for the enemy team, forcing her to rely on her team for protection. She also has 200 health.<p>

<h3> Angelic Descent </h3>
<p>While airborne, Mercy can press and hold the jump button to begin slowly falling to the ground. Letting go of the jump button will end Angelic Descent. 

Mercy will also passively regenerate health after a few seconds of not taking damage.<p>
<br>Healing: 20 health per second after not taking damage for 1 second</br>

<h3> Caduceus Staff </h3>
<p>Primary fire creates a healing tether on the ally closest to Mercy's crosshairs, which remains for as long as Mercy holds down the primary fire button.

Secondary fire creates a damage tether that works similarly to the healing tether but boosts damage instead of healing.</p>
