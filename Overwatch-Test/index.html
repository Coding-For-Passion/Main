<h1> We will be talking about Renzo </h1>
<p> Renzo is one of the greatest ships ever betweeen Reia and Enzo. 
	One of it's well known moments in history was when an anonymous person made a great wifi network in support. This wifi ntetwork is still running today.	
	Enzo of the ship are still shy about admitting he feels affection for Reia. Similarily, it seems to make Reia uncomfortable.
	This website is dedacated to this wonderful relationship.
