<h2> Symmetra </h2>
<p>Symmetra is a unique Support hero who keeps her allies alive through unconventional means. She can deter enemies from traveling through chokepoints with her Sentry Turrets, protect allies while pushing chokepoints with her Photon Barrier, and can dramatically shorten the distance between the respawn room and the frontline with her Teleporter, or give her team a great health advantage with Shield Generator. Despite appearances, she is also one of the most damaging of the Support heroes, with a weapon that can deal devastating damage at both short and long range. Despite this, her complete inability to heal her allies, along with her relative fragility, makes it challenging for her to serve as the only Support on a team. She also has 100 health and 100 shields.<p>

<h3> Photon Projector </h3>
<p>Symmetra's primary weapon. The primary fire creates a beam that tethers to the first hostile target in range, dealing increasing damage for as long as the beam remains active. The beam will fall off if the tethered target moves out of Symmetra's vision. The primary firing mode ignores Genji's Deflect.<p>

<h3> Energy Ball </h3>

<h3> Sentry Turret </h3>
<p>When activated, Symmetra enters a targeting mode, which she can use to place a Sentry Turret on a solid surface. Sentry Turrets have 1 Health and automatically fire on the first enemy that enters their range, dealing continual damage and slowing them. Sentry Turret works on a charge-based system, where Symmetra gains a new charge (up to a maximum of 6) every few seconds. Symmetra can have a maximum of 6 Sentry Turrets up at once. Placing a new Sentry Turret in excess of 6 will destroy the oldest Turret that was placed.</p>
